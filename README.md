# GraphQL Security Toolkit

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a4a34055b4e7479c864c2b23d12007a2)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/sdffsdaf/graph-ql?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=sdffsdaf/graph-ql&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

With the increasing popularity of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) technology, we will be using this repository to publish scripts and other resources that can facilitate security testing efforts.

## GraphQL Introspection
*Author:* Paolo Stagno ([@Void_Sec](https://twitter.com/Void_Sec) - [voidsec.com](https://voidsec.com)) 

A tool to query a GraphQL endpoint with introspection in order to retrieve the documentation of all the Queries, Mutations & Subscriptions.
The script will also generate templates (with optional placeholders) for all the known types, useful for Burp Suite repeater.

The resulting HTML page will contain details for all available Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions as shown here:

### Future Updates

We are currenyly working on "porting" this script into a Burp Extension with a nice and clean GUI.
Do not be afraid, it will also be possible to use it as a stand-alone script.
